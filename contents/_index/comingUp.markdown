Coming up May 21st:

In our past two sessions, we have begun learning the basic skills required to create a platfomer game in [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu). We have learned to create a scrolling background, to animate our player and to make it jump with the appearance of gravity.

On the 21st, we will wrap up this project with the addition of two more skills: collision detection and keeping score. Our player will vulnerable to running into some objects, have the ability to collect others - which will make our project really feel like a real game. It's our last session before taking a break for summer and we're expecting a special visit from a VIP of the global CoderDojo community. Not to be missed!
