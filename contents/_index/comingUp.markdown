<p id="info"><em>Fremont CoderDojo is fun place to learn to code games, websites, and apps for young people between age 7 and 17.</em> We meet every 1st and 3rd Thursday of the month, at 7:00PM. This season we are learning skills in Scratch, HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. No experience necessary. Come to get inspired and share your creativity with others. Bring a laptop if you have one; if not we have a few loaners available first-come-first-served.</p>

<p id="info">For the Fall/Winter Season, we will focus on learning to program the Web with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript!</p>

<h2>Fremont CoderDojo will not be meeting in September, 2019.</h2>
