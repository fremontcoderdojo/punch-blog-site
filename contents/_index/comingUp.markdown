On the agenda for April 16:
- A second tutorial in Processing, with [sketchpad.cc](http://sketchpad.cc) and [funprogramming.org](http://funprogramming.org). Processing is a language based on Java, especially great for beginners and working with graphics. One of our CoderDojo Dad's has created some sketches [here](http://studio.sketchpad.cc/sp/padlist/edited-by?editorId=18274).
- We will learn to [create a scrolling background](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/55592334/#editor) in Scratch.
