Fremont CoderDojo is a programming club for young people between age 7 and 17. Attendees learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, and games in a fun, social environment.

##Ticketing
Free tickets are available through [EventBright](http://fremontcoderdojo.eventbright.com). Each events tickets will be released about 2 weeks prior. We plan to hold most of our events on Thursdays, about twice a month.

##Registration and Finding Your Seat
The event starts at 7:00PM. I recommend arriving 10 to 15 minutes early to give yourself time to locate the Activities Building, register, and get set up on wifi. Remember, you will need to bring your own (or borrowed) laptop to use. Parents will complete registration by signing in minors. They will need to sign agreement to a waiver and child protection policy. Parents/guardians of children under the age of 13 will be required to stay for the duration of the club. Parents of those 13 and over will provide emergency contact information. We have a section of tables for parents to hang out at and a separate section of tables for young people. 

##Wifi
One of the first things you will want to do is get connected to the internet. Look for the network called ‘coderdojo’. The password is ‘codeme2014’.

##Presentation
There will usually be a short presentation covering a few key ideas in a new language or library we are learning together. We will be learning some basics to get you started creating your own games, apps and websites with tools like [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu), HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Python.

##Young Coder Presentations
Before everything wraps up at 8:30PM, we want to give a few young people the opportunity to present their own coding projects to the group. If you have something you’d like to share, let one of our mentors know and we will try to fit you in.
