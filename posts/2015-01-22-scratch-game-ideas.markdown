*In the past months, we have learned some important [skills](http://cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__7aa8454d4311dd1140d332d797f6ca21__//pdfs/help/Scratch2Cards.pdf) in Scratch, covering topics like: loops, conditions, keeping score, responding to the keyboard or mouse, and moving sprites across the screen. Let's put those skills to use in a cooperative challenge!*

###Guidlines:
- Fun games are challenging, but not impossible to win.
- Your game should have a beginning and an end.
- Your game should keep score or track achievment somehow.
- Your game can be inspired by another project, but should have original work.
- If you copy ideas for a script from another project, make sure you can explain how it works. 
- Your game should be a co-operative effort of more than one person.

### Ideas for Inspiration:
- [Falling objects](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10116127/)
- [Avoid something](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/28557874/)
- [Remember Sounds](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11604118/)
- [Guessing Game](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2311357/)
- [Memory](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2578707/)
- [Maze](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2865532/)
