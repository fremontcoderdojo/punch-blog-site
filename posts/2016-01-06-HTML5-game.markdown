### Setting up the environment:

* Here is the code on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/thehack/pen/OMmJed/)
* Here is the [PDF](/img/html5.pdf)

###NOTE: Code Change! 

I've changed:
<pre>setInterval setTimeout and clearInterval</pre> to:
<pre>window.setInterval, window.setTimeout, and window.clearInterval</pre>

I'm hoping that it fixes some issues a user was having with Internet Explorer. If you are using Internet Explorer, [I'd love to hear](mailto:fremont.us@coderdojo.com) your results.
