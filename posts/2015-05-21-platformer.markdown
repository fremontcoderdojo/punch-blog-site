### Getting Going:
In our previous tutorials, we covered creating a scrolling background, an animated character, and controlling jumping with the spacebar. In this tutorial, we will create custom functions to control the movement and collisions of coins and rocks, and keep track of score and lives. To get started, [Right-click this link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/63621710/#editor) open in a new tab, and click on the yellow remix button to save the project in your own scratch account.
 
### The Coin
The coin needs to be able to know when the player is touching it and add to the score and generate a new coin.

### The Rock
The rock also needs to be able to detect the player touching it, remove lives, and generate new rocks.
